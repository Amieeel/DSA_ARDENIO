Hi Sir ! the past few weeks, I've been coding in the codespace unknowingly
na hindi po pala siya "public" na space or basically it's inaccessible. 
I just found this out recently, thank goodness po na nadiscover pa hehehe.
I downloaded all the files from the codespace and now it's properly in the repository.
